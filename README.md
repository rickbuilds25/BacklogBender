# 🌀 BacklogBender

> “You don’t need more tickets. You need a roadmap that breathes.”

BacklogBender is the product manager’s chaos whisperer. Got a pile of Jira tickets, messy ideas, and Notion docs that look like a crime scene? Feed it in. It scores, slices, and sequences it all into a clear, sharp, *“hell yes” roadmap.*

You don’t just ship features. You ship momentum. And BacklogBender makes sure every sprint stacks up to something bigger.
